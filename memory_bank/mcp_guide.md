You're thinking like a solo founder who needs to leverage every tool at their disposal â€“ good! MCP (likely referring to **Microsoft Copilot**, though the principles apply to any advanced AI coding assistant like **GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code/Cursor**, or even **Cursor's own AI features**) can be a phenomenal force multiplier *if used correctly*.

The key is to not treat MCP as an autonomous developer, but as an **extremely fast, knowledgeable, but sometimes naive junior developer** who needs clear direction, context, and review.

Here's how you, as the lead developer/founder, can strategically use MCP to accelerate most tasks on the "Prompt Pulse" project, keeping our Code Quality, UI/UX, and Task Breakdown documents in mind:

**Core Strategy: MCP as Your "Smart Intern"**

1.  **You are the Architect & Lead:** You define *what* needs to be built (from our roadmap & task breakdown), *why* (user stories, value prop), and *how it should fit* (tech stack, design guide, quality rules).
2.  **MCP is the Implementer (for drafts):** MCP helps generate the *first draft* of code, handles boilerplate, researches syntax, and implements well-defined logic based on your instructions.
3.  **You are the Reviewer & Refiner:** You *always* review MCP's output, ensure it aligns with our standards, test it, and refine it. MCP accelerates, you ensure quality.

**Using MCP for Specific Tasks in "Prompt Pulse" (with examples):**

We'll go phase by phase, illustrating how MCP can help with specific tasks from our "Project Progress Tracker":

**Phase 1: Niche Strategy & Foundation**

*   **Task 1.1 (Niche Research):**
    *   **MCP Use:** Less for direct coding. More for *research assistance*.
    *   **Your Prompt Example to MCP:** "Summarize the top 5 pain points for B2B SDRs based on these 10 articles [paste links or summaries]." or "List common software tools used by e-commerce marketers for product descriptions and their typical API capabilities."
    *   **Benefit:** Accelerates information synthesis.
*   **Task 1.2 (Project Setup):**
    *   **MCP Use:** Excellent for generating boilerplate and configuration.
    *   **Your Prompt Example:** "Initialize a Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Generate the standard `tsconfig.json` and `tailwind.config.js`."
    *   **Benefit:** Skips manual setup steps.
*   **Task 1.3 (Authentication):**
    *   **MCP Use:** Generating UI components for login/signup, basic API route stubs.
    *   **Your Prompt Example:** "Generate a React functional component for a login form using email/password with Clerk (or Firebase Auth) SDK integration. Include basic input validation and loading/error states." or "Create a Next.js API route at `/api/auth/me` that verifies the user's session using the Clerk (or Firebase) admin SDK and returns the user ID and role."
    *   **Benefit:** Generates standard auth UI and backend hooks quickly. **Review security aspects carefully.**
*   **Task 1.4 (Basic Database):**
    *   **MCP Use:** Generating SQL schema drafts based on descriptions, basic Supabase RLS policy drafts.
    *   **Your Prompt Example:** "Generate the SQL schema (PostgreSQL syntax) for a `users` table with columns: `id (uuid, primary key, default uuid_generate_v4())`, `auth_id (uuid, unique, references auth.users(id) on delete cascade)`, `email (text, unique, not null)`, `role (text, default 'free')`, `created_at (timestamp with time zone, default now())`. Also generate a Supabase RLS policy so users can only select their own row."
    *   **Benefit:** Speeds up schema creation. **Crucial: Always review generated SQL and RLS policies for correctness and security before applying.**

**Phase 2: Core Niche Workflow MVP**

*   **Task 2.1 (Niche Workflow UI):**
    *   **MCP Use:** Generating React components for input forms and output displays based on the UI/UX guide.
    *   **Your Prompt Example:** "Create a React component for a niche task input form. It should include fields: [list fields and types from your Niche Workflow definition]. Use Tailwind CSS for styling according to the project's design system (refer to `000-project-standards.mdc` and `UI/UX Design Guide`). Ensure accessibility for form inputs."
*   **Task 2.2 (LLM Backend):**
    *   **MCP Use:** Generating the API endpoint, LLM API call logic, and basic prompt assembly.
    *   **Your Prompt Example:** "Create a Next.js API route at `/api/generateNicheOutput`. It should: 1. Authenticate the user. 2. Receive `inputData` (JSON). 3. Construct a prompt for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo using this base template: `[your base prompt]` and inject `inputData` fields. 4. Call the OpenAI API. 5. Return the text response or handle errors (log to Sentry, return user-friendly error message). Refer to `backend/300-node-serverless.mdc` and `LLM Juice Strategy`."
    *   **Benefit:** Handles API SDK boilerplate. **Crucial: Review prompt engineering and error handling.**

**Phase 3: First Key Integration MVP**

*   **Task 3.2 (Build Integration Backend - OAuth):**
    *   **MCP Use:** Generating the OAuth handshake routes and token storage/refresh logic for a *specific API* (e.g., Hubspot).
    *   **Your Prompt Example:** "Implement the backend Node.js/Express (or Next.js API routes) for the Hubspot OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow. Create: 1. `/api/integrations/hubspot/connect` to redirect to Hubspot's auth URL. 2. `/api/integrations/hubspot/callback` to handle the callback, exchange code for tokens, and securely store encrypted access/refresh tokens in the Supabase `integration_credentials` table linked to the user ID. Refer to `backend/400-data-storage-integrations.mdc` for security."
    *   **Benefit:** Handles complex OAuth boilerplate. **Crucial: Thoroughly review token handling security.**
*   **Task 3.2 (Build Integration Backend - API Calls):**
    *   **MCP Use:** Generating functions to call specific endpoints of the integrated tool's API.
    *   **Your Prompt Example:** "In the `services/integrations/hubspot.ts` module, create an async function `getHubspotContact(userId, contactId)` that: 1. Retrieves the user's Hubspot access token from the database. 2. Refreshes the token if necessary. 3. Calls the Hubspot API GET endpoint `/crm/v3/objects/contacts/{contactId}`. 4. Returns the contact data or throws a specific error. Implement retries for network errors. Log API calls and errors. Refer to `backend/400-data-storage-integrations.mdc`."

**Phase 4-9: General Approach for Subsequent Phases**

*   **UI Components (e.g., Paywall Modal, Library Item Card, Extension Popup):**
    *   **MCP Prompt:** "Generate a React component for [component name] as described in `UI/UX Design Guide section X`. It should take props: [list props and types]. Style with Tailwind. Fetch data from [API endpoint] if needed. Handle loading/error states. Implement User Story Y.Z acceptance criteria."
*   **Backend Endpoints (e.g., `/api/saveNicheOutput`, Webhook Handler):**
    *   **MCP Prompt:** "Create a Next.js API route at `[endpoint path]`. It should perform these actions: [list actions, e.g., authenticate user, validate input using Zod schema [provide schema], interact with [DB table/Integration service], log events, return [response type]]. Adhere to rules in `backend/300-node-serverless.mdc` and `backend/400-data-storage-integrations.mdc`."
*   **Content Scripts (Chrome Extension):**
    *   **MCP Prompt:** "Write a Chrome Extension content script (`content.js`) for `[target website domain]` that: 1. Detects when the user is on `[specific page URL pattern or identifies element with ID 'xyz']`. 2. Extracts text from `[DOM selector_1]` and `[DOM selector_2]`. 3. Sends this data to the background script. 4. Listens for a message from background with generated text. 5. Injects this text into the textarea with ID `[target_textarea_id]` and triggers an 'input' event. Refer to `frontend/200-chrome-extension.mdc` for reliability and error handling." **MCP will struggle here the most due to dynamic DOMs. Extensive manual review is needed.**
*   **Boilerplate & Utilities:**
    *   **MCP Prompt:** "Generate a utility function in `utils/formatting.ts` to [describe formatting task, e.g., 'format a date string to DD/MM/YYYY']." or "Create a custom React hook `useApi(endpoint, options)` that handles fetching data, loading state, and error state."

**Best Practices for Using MCP Effectively:**

1.  **Be Specific & Contextual:** The more context you give (linking to user stories, design docs, existing code patterns, specific file paths), the better the output. Don't just say "build login"; say "build login UI component as per User Story 1.3, using Clerk, and place it in `components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`."
2.  **Iterative Refinement:** Use MCP to generate a first draft. Then, ask it to refine, add error handling, add tests, or style it according to specific Tailwind classes.
3.  **One Small Task at a Time:** Give MCP focused, bite-sized tasks from your "Project Progress Tracker." This aligns with its strengths and makes review easier.
4.  **Refer to Your Rules:** Constantly remind MCP about your project standards. "Ensure this code follows DRY and KISS principles from `000-project-standards.mdc`." "Validate inputs according to the Zod schema and handle errors as per `user-feedback-errors.mdc`."
5.  **Provide Existing Code Examples:** If you have a pattern you like, provide it. "Refactor this function to follow the pattern in `utils/apiClient.ts` for error handling."
6.  **Review, Review, Review:** MCP can make mistakes, introduce subtle bugs, or deviate from best practices if not guided well. Your SDE experience is crucial here. **Always understand the code MCP generates.**
7.  **Test MCP's Output:** Write unit tests (or ask MCP to help generate them) for logic MCP creates.
8.  **Use "Chat" or "Edit in Place" Features:** Tools like Cursor allow you to select code and chat about it, or ask MCP to edit a specific block. This is very powerful for refactoring or adding specific logic.
9.  **Prompt for "Thinking Process":** Sometimes it's helpful to ask MCP, "How would you approach implementing [task X]? List the steps." This can help you understand its plan before it generates code.
10. **Don't Forget Documentation (MDC Rule):** "Add JSDoc comments to this function explaining its parameters and return value as per `030-documentation-standards.mdc`."
