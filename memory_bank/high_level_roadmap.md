*   **Step 1.1: Niche Deep Dive & Problem Crystallization**
    *   *Description:* Conduct intensive qualitative research (20-30 structured interviews, workflow observation) with [Chosen Niche Professionals]. Identify the **single most significant, time-consuming, and financially impactful problem** solvable with AI-assisted workflow integration. Validate this problem with quantitative data where possible (market size, tool usage stats).
    *   *(Implementation Note: This is 90% research, 10% documentation. The output is a Niche Validation Report. **NO major coding starts before this is clear.**)*
    *   *(Prompt Idea for AI: "Analyze transcripts of [X] user interviews for common themes related to daily inefficiencies in using [Tool Y] for [Niche Task Z]." or "Generate a summary of top-rated features and complaints for competing AI tools targeting [Chosen Niche].")*
*   **Step 1.2: MVP Integration Feasibility & Target Selection**
    *   *Description:* For the validated Niche Problem, identify the 1-2 most commonly used software tools. Conduct a **thorough technical due diligence** on their APIs (OAuth, read/write capabilities for essential MVP context, rate limits, documentation quality). Select *one* primary integration target for the MVP.
    *   *(Implementation Note: Output is an API Feasibility Report and chosen integration. This avoids building towards an impossible integration.)*
    *   *(Prompt Idea for AI: "Summarize the OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant) flow documentation for [Target Tool API V.X]." or "Identify rate limits and data access scopes for the [Target Tool API] related to [contact records / email drafts].")*
*   **Step 1.3: Core Technical Infrastructure Setup**
    *   *Description:* Provision Git repository, CI/CD pipeline (Vercel/Netlify/Google Cloud Build), Next.js project (TypeScript, Tailwind), Authentication Service (Clerk/Firebase Auth), and initial Database (Supabase/Cloud SQL) with basic schemas (`users`, `subscriptions`, skeleton `integration_credentials` & `niche_outputs`). Implement fundamental Row Level Security.
    *   *(Implementation Note: Automate deployments from day one. Secure default configurations. Document environment variable setup.)*
    *   *(Prompt Idea for AI: "Generate a basic Next.js starter with TypeScript, Tailwind, and ESLint/Prettier configured." or "Write Supabase RLS policies for the 'users' table to allow users to only select/update their own record.")*

    *   *Description:* Build backend service function to fetch necessary context data (e.g., contact details, deal information) from the [Chosen Tool API] using the authenticated user's token.
    *   *(Implementation Note: Abstract this into an integration-specific service module. Handle API errors gracefully.)*
    *   *(Prompt Idea for AI: "In `services/integrations/[chosenTool].ts`, create an async function `getContext(userId, contextId)` to fetch [specific data] from [Chosen Tool API endpoint] using the user's access token.")*
*   **Step 3.3: Update Core Workflow to Use Integrated Context**
    *   *Description:* Modify the frontend UI (Phase 2.2) and backend LLM endpoint (Phase 2.3) to:
        *   Allow user to select context (e.g., a specific contact) from the connected [Chosen Tool].
        *   Pull this context via the backend service (Step 3.2).
        *   Use this context to pre-fill inputs and enhance the LLM prompt.
    *   *(Implementation Note: Show visual cues for pre-filled data.)*
    *   *(Prompt Idea for AI: "Modify the React InputForm component to fetch and pre-fill fields with data from `/api/integrations/[chosenTool]/getContext` when an integrated record is selected.")*
*   **Step 3.4: Implement Basic "Apply Output" to [Chosen Tool API]**
    *   *Description:* Build backend service function to write the AI-generated output back to the [Chosen Tool API] (e.g., create a draft email, update a note field). Add an "Apply" button to the frontend.
    *   *(Implementation Note: Critical MVP feature. Focus on one simple "write" action initially. Handle external API errors.)*
    *   *(Prompt Idea for AI: "In `services/integrations/[chosenTool].ts`, create an async function `applyOutput(userId, outputData, contextId)` to POST/PUT the output to [Chosen Tool API endpoint for applying MVP action].")*

    *   *(Implementation Note: Content script DOM selectors are fragile; start very specific. Popup should be fast.)*
    *   *(Prompt Idea for AI: "Write a content script for domain `[chosenTool.com]` that identifies when the URL matches `/contacts/\*` and extracts the text from an element with ID `contact-name-display`.")*
*   **Step 7.3: Implement Basic Output Injection ([Chosen Tool])**
    *   *Description:* Implement logic for the extension to generate output (via backend API call from background script) and then for the content script to inject this output into a *specific, predefined input field* on the [Chosen Tool]'s page.
    *   *(Implementation Note: **This is the hardest part technically.** Focus on one specific target field. Trigger 'input'/'change' events after injection.)*
    *   *(Prompt Idea for AI: "Write content script code to find a textarea with name `email_body` on `[chosenTool.com/compose]` and programmatically set its value with text received via message passing, then dispatch an 'input' event.")*

    *   *(Implementation Note: Secure these endpoints.)*
    *   *(Prompt Idea for AI: "Create a Next.js API route `/api/billing/create-checkout-session` that uses the Stripe SDK to create a checkout session for a given plan ID and returns the session URL.")*
*   **Step 8.3: Implement Secure Payment Webhook Handler**
    *   *Description:* Create a dedicated backend endpoint to receive webhook events from the payment gateway. **Critically, verify webhook signatures.** Update user roles and subscription status in the database based on events like `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated/deleted`.
    *   *(Implementation Note: Webhook handling must be idempotent and highly reliable. Log all received webhooks and processing outcomes.)*
    *   *(Prompt Idea for AI: "Write a Node.js serverless function to handle Stripe webhooks, ensuring signature verification, and update the user's 'role' in Supabase based on `checkout.session.completed` and `customer.subscription.deleted` events.")*
*   **Step 8.4: Build Subscription Management UI**
    *   *Description:* Create a "Billing" page in user settings to display current plan and provide buttons/links to upgrade (to checkout) or manage existing subscription (to customer portal).
    *   *(Implementation Note: Frontend fetches user's current plan status from backend.)*
    *   *(Prompt Idea for AI: "Create a React component for a billing page that displays the user's current plan and shows an 'Upgrade to Pro' button if they are 'free', or a 'Manage Subscription' button if they are 'pro' or 'team'.")*
