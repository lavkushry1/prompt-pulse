# Prompt Pulse: Core User Epics & Value Delivery (Niche Focus)

**Purpose:** This document outlines the fundamental capabilities and value Prompt Pulse will deliver to its chosen Niche Professionals. Each Epic describes a core user journey and desired outcome. Its child Stories (not fully expanded here but referencing the previous list) and Acceptance Criteria define the specific, verifiable conditions that prove we've delivered on that promise. This ensures our AI coding assistant stays focused on implementing features that directly contribute to solving a meaningful user problem.

**Note for AI Tools:** Focus on implementing the **Acceptance Criteria (AC)** within each User Story referenced by these Epics. The Epics provide strategic context. Pay close attention to placeholders: `[Niche Role]`, `[Niche Task]`, `[Integrated Tool]`, and `[Specific Value Delivered]`. The success of Prompt Pulse hinges on delivering these outcomes flawlessly.

*   Users can manually input or override context.
*   The core UI provides a clear separation between input, generation controls, and output display.

**Strategic Considerations for Implementation (AI Focus):**
*   The connection and data pulling from the [Integrated Tool] must be reliable and secure.
*   UI for context display needs to clearly differentiate auto-pulled data from manual inputs.

**High-Level Acceptance:**
*   Paid users have access to controls like "Remix," "Tone Adjuster," and specific "[Niche Task] Optimizers."
*   These controls result in measurably different and potentially improved outputs.
*   This functionality is clearly gated and not available to free users.

**Strategic Considerations for Implementation (AI Focus):**
*   The LLM prompts for "Remix" and "Optimize" need to be carefully crafted to produce meaningful changes.
*   The UI for these controls should be intuitive and adjacent to the output display.
*   Track usage of these features to understand which optimizations are most valued by the niche.

## Epic 4: In-Workflow Application & Productivity Boost (via Chrome Extension)

**User Outcome:** A [Niche Role] professional can invoke Prompt Pulse, generate relevant output, and apply it directly within their primary [Integrated Tool] (e.g., CRM, Email Composer, Ad Platform) without leaving the tool, resulting in massive time savings and reduced context switching.

**Referenced User Stories:** 5, 10

**Key Value Points for Niche:**
*   The core promise: "AI where you work." Elimination of copy-pasting.
*   Contextual suggestions accelerate the start of a task (User Story 5).
*   Direct "Apply" functionality (User Story 10) offers a near-magical experience.
*   Increased data accuracy in [Integrated Tool] by reducing manual re-entry.

**High-Level Acceptance:**
*   The Chrome Extension reliably detects when the user is on a supported [Integrated Tool] page.
*   The Extension popup can display context-aware suggestions based on page content.
*   The Extension can generate relevant [Niche Task] output.
*   The Extension's "Apply" function correctly injects the generated output into the appropriate field on the [Integrated Tool]'s web page.
*   The Extension securely syncs authentication state with the web app.

**Strategic Considerations for Implementation (AI Focus):**
*   The reliability of context extraction and DOM injection by content scripts is **CRITICAL and will be the hardest technical challenge.** Focus MVP on the *most stable and common* interactions within the 1st [Integrated Tool].
*   The Extension popup UI must be *extremely fast* and responsive.
*   Clear error handling and user feedback are essential for extension interactions (e.g., "Could not find field to apply to").
