# Prompt Pulse: The Path of Mindful Development (Niche Focus)

**Purpose:** This document guides our iterative journey in creating Prompt Pulse. It streamlines the development tasks, focusing on delivering *intentional value* at each stage. It serves as our conscious backlog, reminding us of the *why* behind each *what*.

**Note for Developer & AI Assistant:** Each phase on this path represents a mindful cycle of learning and building. The "Essence" defines the core intention. "Key Realizations" are milestones within that essence. Approach each step with clarity of purpose, referring to other scrolls (User Stories, Tech Stack) for specific knowledge, but always returning to the essence of value delivery for our Niche. This is a path, not a rigid set of instructions. Be prepared to adapt with new insights.
