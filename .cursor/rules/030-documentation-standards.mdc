# Prompt Pulse: Internal Documentation Standards

**Purpose:** Defines requirements for code-level documentation to ensure the codebase remains understandable and maintainable over time for a solo developer.

**Note for AI Tools:** When generating code, follow these standards for adding comments and documentation.

---

## üìù Code-Level Documentation

*   **Guideline:** Add comments and documentation where the *why* or *how* is not immediately obvious from the code itself.
*   **AI Rule:**
    *   **Function/Component Purpose:** For any function, class, or significant React component (especially those used in multiple places or performing complex logic), generate a brief JSDoc or TSdoc comment explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.
    *   **Non-Obvious Logic:** Add inline comments to explain complex algorithms, workarounds, or decisions that deviate from standard practices.
    *   **Integration Specifics:** For code interacting with external APIs (especially content scripts or integration backend modules), add comments explaining specific API requirements, known quirks, or DOM selectors being used and why.

## üìÇ Module/Directory Documentation

*   **Guideline:** Briefly explain the purpose of directories or core modules.
*   **AI Rule:** When creating a new directory for a significant module (e.g., `services/integrations/hubspot`, `components/workflows/coldEmail`), suggest creating a brief `README.md` file in that directory explaining its purpose and the main files it contains.
